           My name is Jason Tashman and I grew up in Northern Virginia but currently reside in the suburbs of Baltimore,
           Maryland.  Interest in programming and web developement has always been present due to being around technology
           all growing up and my sister currently being a front end web dev in Berlin, Germany.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have always been a fan of computers and recently have grown an intrest in web developement and especially backend framework.
            I am hoping that with this bootcamp that I will gain the knowledge to serve me and provide me with enough
            insight to make this a life long journey of learning and progressing.
